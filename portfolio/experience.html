                    Being a web developer at the Marriott School is definitely a rewarding experience. I am able to participate
                    in the maintenance and creation of the website for the business college at BYU. I am given projects to
                    complete, utilizing a number of programming languages, such as php, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, in
                    addition to pure problem-solving abilities. As well, I have been able to hone customer service skills as I
                    help various departments have the website that they want.

                    Having recently started teaching at Lincoln Academy Junior High, I have been able to develop an even
                    greater love for teaching and mentoring youth. In addition, it has been a great opportunity to hone my web
                    development skills as I have developed a curriculum to use for my class. The curriculum I developed will
                    help the students learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and basic internet skills.

                    nicest buildings on the BYU campus. My duties include working in a team, ensuring coordination of
                    multiple events within the building, often at the same time, and locking up the building at night.
