                    <p>
                        Shadowing physicians and surgeons for over 80 hours in Zaragoza, Spain gave me an even stronger desire to be the best
                        healthcare professional I can be. What's more, I was able to design a website to help them with their scheduling of patients.
                        <a href="http://hospital.haydenareed.com/scheduling/">Here is a preview of the website.</a>

                <h3><b>Spartan Tips</b></h3>
                    <p>
                        This website was inspired through a good friend of mine. Together we trained and completed a 9-mile Spartan Race. It was tough,
                        but we both became stronger through it. This website is a blog dedicated to helping people improve themselves in all aspects of life,
                        drawing upon the ennobling values of the legendary Spartans. This ethos has helped many become better.

                <h3><b>Marriott School Website</b></h3>
                    <p>
                        I work as a web developer with the Marriott School of Business at BYU. Here, I am able to help maintain and improve the website used
                        by the business students. It is an exciting process, and I enjoy my job. Recently, I built a system to manage the incorrect time punches by employess,
                        and there are always projects to be doing.
